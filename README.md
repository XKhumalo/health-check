# Health Check

Health Check is a process where a team-member identifies whether a certain category (outlined with examples)  is going well, average, or poorly. It helps to identify any problems as well as trends that could occur in a team. It checks the health of the team.

The team-member will receive a category, then extreme examples of a good aspect, as well as a bad aspect. They will then decide if they strongly agree with the criteria for the category, strongly disagree, or somewhere in the middle. The choices will be selected by:

- Green = Strongly agree
- Yellow = Agree to Disagree
- Red = Strongly disagree

### Example

**Category**: *Team Work*

​		Green: "We are a totally gelled team with awesome collaboration!"
​		Red: "We are a bunch of individuals that don't care what others are doing"

  - Should you think your team is quite close & helps each other out a lot, you would probably select green
  - Should you think you are all alone, you would probably select red
  - Should you not be sure of whether you are apart of the team or not, you would probably select yellow
